Question 2.

	Essential features to be provided :
	1. Should be able to access Admin policies
	2. 

	Technology stack should be :

	Fraework :
	Spring boot with micro services :
		- Its easy to maintain and debug the code by policy wise as we create policy wise micro services
		- Spring boot offering faster as well as widely accessible ‘Getting Started’ experience for the majority of the Spring development.
		  Also, it reduces Developer’s effort
		- It makes it easier to integrate the Spring Boot Application with the Spring Ecosystem that majorly includes Spring ORM, Spring JDBC,  
		  Spring Security, Spring Data and many other things.
		- It tests the web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers that includes Tomcat, Jetty and many others.
		- It offers a number of plugins for working with embedded and in-memory databases easily.
	Database :
		MySql :
		As its open source.
	UI :
		Angular JS 2.0 or above :
		- As AngularJS 2.0 stress more on browsers like IE10/11, Chrome, Firefox, Opera & Safari on the desktop and Chrome on Android, Windows Phone 8+, iOS6 & Firefox mobile.
		- Strong and Flexible Routing
		- Reduction of Code
		and many more

	Implementation overview :
		- Will create separate microservices for every policy and using them in main service
		- Will host it on cloud like AWS as it support best scalability and better cluster
		- Will maintain jenkins to continuous build cycle
		- Will provide Sonar cube and cobertura for better code coverage
		
Question 3. Do you take interest in reading technical books or articles, blogs?
	Yes I am.
	Recently I read Spring Data MongoDB article and blogs.
	I have implemented it in my current project.
